# hello-world
feed me, seymour.

## This is me using different Markdown elements

-----------------------

# Things that I need to **understand** better:

  - GitHub
  - Git
  - **CLI**

# The first "languages" that I need to learn:

  1. HTML
  2. CSS
  3. JavaScript

# How I plan to study:

While my main focus right now is learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is important to incorporate other elements into my learning, such as:

  - **Foundational Knowledge**
  - CS Fundamentals
  - Reading lists
  - Video Tutorials
  - Podcasts

This list is not comprehensive. This is a rough starting point.

< I must remain diligent, focused, open, dedicated, *calm* to accomplish my goal.

~~I can do this.~~ I will do this.
